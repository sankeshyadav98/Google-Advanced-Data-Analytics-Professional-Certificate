Without this assumption, we cannot draw causal conclusions about how payment method affects fare amount.\n",

The data was not collected this way; so, an assumption had to be made to randomly group data entries to perform an A/B test. This dataset does not account for other likely explanations. For example, riders might not carry lots of cash, so it's easier to pay for longer/farther trips with a credit card. In other words, it's far more likely that fare amount determines payment type, rather than vice versa. The difference between average card payment fare and cash fare is inflated, because we use the total amount as the comparing variable. But cash fares all have tip values of $0, while card payments have non-zero values. A possible reason for this occurance is because cash tips aren't declared. In turn, this means that we capture tips in one group but not in the other. Instead, one could compare the fare_amount column."
