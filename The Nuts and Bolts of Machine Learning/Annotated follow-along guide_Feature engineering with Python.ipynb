    "The data we will use in this notebook is customer data from a European bank. We will return to this data often throughout this course. Later, we will compare the performance of different models on this data. Be sure to review the [data dictionary](https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-nuts-and-bolts-of-machine-learning/supplement/s7Mux/follow-along-instructions-feature-engineering-with-python) to better acquaint yourself with it.\n",

    "Feature selection is the process of choosing features to be used for modeling. In practice, feature selection takes place at multiple points in the PACE process. Although sometimes you will be given a dataset and a defined target variable, most often in practice you will begin with only a question or a problem that you are tasked with solving. In these cases, if you decide that the problem requires a model, you will then have to:\n",

    "\n",
    "This all takes place during the **Plan** phase. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, during the **Analyze** phase, you perform EDA on the data and reevaluate your variables for appropriateness. For example, can your model handle null values? If not, what do you do with features with a lot of nulls? Perhaps you drop them. This too is feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection also occurs during the **Construct** phase. This usually involves building a model, examining which features are most predictive, and then removing the unpredictive features.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a lot of work involved in feature selection. In this case, we already have a dataset, and we are not performing thorough EDA on it. However, we can still examine the data to ensure that all the features can reasonably be expected to have predictive potential. \n"
