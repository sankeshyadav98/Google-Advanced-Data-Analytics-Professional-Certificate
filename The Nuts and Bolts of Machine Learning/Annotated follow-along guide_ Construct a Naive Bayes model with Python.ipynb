If a customer churns, it means they left the bank and took their business elsewhere. If we can predict customers who are likely to churn, we can take measures to retain them before they do. These measures could be promotions, discounts, or other incentives to boost customer satisfaction and, therefore, retention."

    "This is a classification task, because we are trying to predict on a binary class. Naive Bayes often works well for this kind of task. However, recall that there are several different implementations of the Naive Bayes algorithm in scikit-learn, and each assumes that all of your predictor variables are of a single type (e.g., Gaussian for continuous variables, Bernoulli for binary variables, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "Our data has all different types of predictor variables! As a data professional, one of the first things you'll learn on the job is that real-world data is never perfect. Sometimes the data breaks the assumptions of your model. In practice, you'll have to do the best you can with what you have. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, if we wanted to build the best possible Naive Bayes model, we'd treat each variable according to their different types and distributions, and then combine each conditional probability to get the final prediction for each observation. That's advanced data science, and beyond the scope of this course. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this lesson, we're going to use the `GaussianNB` classifier. This implementation assumes that all of your variables are continuous _and_ that they have a Gaussian (i.e., normal) distribution. Our data doesn't perfectly adhere to these assumptions, but a Gaussian model may still yield usable results, even with imperfect data."

    "One thing that you can usually try when modeling is scaling your predictor variables. Some models require you to scale the data in order for them to operate as expected, others don't. Naive Bayes does not require data scaling. However, sometimes packages and libraries need to make assumptions and approximations in their calculations. We're already breaking some of these assumptions by using the `GaussianNB` classifier on this dataset, and it may not be helping that some of our predictor variables are on very different scales. In general, scaling might not improve the model, but it probably won't make it worse. Let's try scaling our data.\n",

    "All of our model metrics can be derived from the confusion matrix, and each metric tells its own part of the story. What stands out most in the confusion matrix is that the model misses a lot of customers who will churn. In other words, there are a lot of false negatives&mdash;355, to be exact. This is why our recall score is only 0.303. \n",

You'll also learn more about evaluating your models, which takes careful decision-making and consideration for your use case."
